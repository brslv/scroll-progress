# Scroll Progress

A tiny vanilla custom component, which renders a small progress bar on the top of a vertical scrolling page.

Zero dependencies. 👌

### Usage

Just import it and use it as a DOM element.

```javascript
import sp from '@brslv/scroll-progress';

// In your DOM

<scroll-progress></scroll-progress>
```

That's it. 👍

### Configurations

You can configure the height (in `px`) and the color of the bar.

```javascript
<scroll-progress color="#333222" height="3px">
```

Enjoy! ⭐️
