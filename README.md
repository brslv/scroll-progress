# Scroll Progress ¬∑ [![install size](https://packagephobia.now.sh/badge?p=@brslv/scroll-progress)](https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=@brslv/scroll-progress) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/license/brslv/scroll-progress.svg) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/brslv/scroll-progress.svg) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-0-brightgreen.svg) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/custom%20elements-hell%20yeah!-yellow.svg)

A tiny vanilla custom component, which renders a small progress bar on the top of a vertical scrolling page.

Zero dependencies. üëå

No node, browser only.

### Usage

Import the package.

```javascript
import '@brslv/scroll-progress';
```

Then, simply use it in your DOM (just bellow the `<body>` tag, for example).

```html
<body>
    <scroll-progress></scroll-progress>

    <!-- Other stuff... -->
</body>
```

That's it. üëç

### Configurations
| **Prop**    | **Possible values**       |
| ----------- |---------------------------|
| color       | any valid css color prop  |
| height      | any valid css height prop |
| position    | `top` / `bottom`          |

Example:

```html
<scroll-progress color="#333222" height="3px" position="bottom"></scroll-progress>
```

### FAQ
**Can I use this with React/Angular/Vue/Whatever-modern-framework?**

Yep, you can.
For example, in a react application, you can simply render this as any other built-in DOM element:
```html
<div>
    <scroll-progress></scroll-progress>

    {/* Other components bellow */}

    <MyCustomComponent />
</div>
```

**Which browsers do you support.**

This is built on top of the [custom elements specification](https://www.webcomponents.org/specs). That's why you should take into consideration the following [browser support table](https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1) for *Custom Elements v1*.

Enjoy! ‚≠êÔ∏è
