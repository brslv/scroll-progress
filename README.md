# Scroll Progress

A tiny vanilla custom component, which renders a small progress bar on the top of a vertical scrolling page.

Zero dependencies. üëå

### Usage

Import the package.

```javascript
import sp from '@brslv/scroll-progress';
```

Then, simply use it in your DOM (just bellow the `body` tag, for example).

```html
<body>
    <scroll-progress></scroll-progress>

    <!-- Other stuff... -->
</body>
```

That's it. üëç

### Configurations

You can configure the height (in `px`) and the color of the bar.

```html
<scroll-progress color="#333222" height="3px"></scroll-progress>
```

Enjoy! ‚≠êÔ∏è
